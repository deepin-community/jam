The Jambase.gz file contains the default builtin rules for jam.  It is
often useful as a reference, to understand what's going on, as jam is
so radically different from make(1).

Other useful docs and tutorials are available through
http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html, in the "White Papers and Examples"
section.
