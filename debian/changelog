jam (2.5rel-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Switched to dh.
  * Switched to source format 3.0 (quilt).  Keep the %token reordering
    patch to jamgram.y as jamgram.patch, but don't apply it as it does not

    changelog.
  * Backup shipped versions of generated files (used for bootstrapping)
    before regenerating them, and restore them on clean.
  * Adjust debian/watch and debian/copyright for current upstream
    directory hierarchy (Closes: #529119).
  * Spell "cumulative" correctly in manpage and html (Closes: #412606).

jam (2.5rel-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Final 2.5 release - using this version string to compensate for the
    mistake about rc2 (see below).

    bootstrapping jam0 failed.  
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1, no change.
  * Removed the call to "./jam0 clean" from clean rules, since it removes
    files necessary to bottstrap the build.
